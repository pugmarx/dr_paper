# Dr. Paper Website

This directory contains the static website files for Dr. Paper - a curated collection of research papers with AI-generated summaries.

## Files

- `index.html` - Main website page
- `styles.css` - Website styling with light/dark themes
- `script.js` - Interactive functionality (search, filtering, etc.)
- `papers.json` - Paper data generated from Notion database (auto-generated)
- `images/` - Website assets including logo

## Features

- 🔍 **Search** across titles, authors, summaries, and topics
- 🏷️ **Filter** by topic/category
- 📅 **Sort** by date (newest first)
- 🌙 **Dark/light theme** toggle
- 📱 **Responsive design** for mobile and desktop
- 🔗 **Direct links** to ArXiv and PDF files
- 📤 **Share functionality** for individual papers

## Development

The website automatically loads data from `papers.json`, which is generated by the GitHub Action from your Notion database. If the JSON file is not available, it falls back to demo data for development.

### Local Development

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. The website will use demo data if `papers.json` is not present
3. To test with real data, run the Notion-to-website generator:
   ```bash
   cd src/
   python notion_to_website.py
   ```

## Deployment

The website is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions:

- **Triggers**: Daily at 6 AM UTC, manual dispatch, or pushes to main
- **Process**: Fetches latest papers from Notion → Generates JSON → Deploys to Pages
- **URL**: Available at your GitHub Pages URL
